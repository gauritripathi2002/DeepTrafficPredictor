# Traffic Flow Prediction Using LSTM

Welcome to the Traffic Flow Prediction project, where we leverage the power of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to forecast vehicle traffic flow. 

## Project Description

This project involves building and training an LSTM model using Keras to predict future traffic flow based on historical data. The primary dataset used is a time series of vehicle counts, and the model aims to accurately forecast future vehicle counts.

### Key Components of the Project:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Importing necessary libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Keras.
   - Loading the traffic data (`traffic.csv`) and applying Min-Max scaling for normalization.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Developing an LSTM-based Sequential model with Dense layers.
   - Compiling the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Training the LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
   - Observing the training process over 10 epochs, noting the gradual decrease in loss.

4. **Making Predictions:**
   - Generating traffic flow predictions for both the training and testing sets.
   - Inverse scaling the predictions to match the original data scale for accurate comparison.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

6. **Data Visualization:**
   - Plotting the original data, training, and testing predictions to visualize the model's performance.
   - Comparing actual vs. predicted traffic counts for both training and testing sets using Matplotlib.

### Future Enhancements

- **Data Enrichment:** Incorporating additional features such as weather conditions, special events, or time of day to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Optimization:** Experimenting with different LSTM architectures, hyperparameters, or advanced techniques like bidirectional LSTM.
- **Deployment:** Developing a web application or an API for real-time traffic prediction.
